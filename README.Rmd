# bootstraplib

Tools for styling **shiny** and **rmarkdown** from R via Bootstrap (3 or 4) Sass.

## Installation

**bootstraplib** isnâ€™t yet available from CRAN, but you can install with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("rstudio/bootstraplib")
library(bootstraplib)
```

## Introduction

The **bootstraplib** R package provides tools for compiling and working with [Bootstrap Sass](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/theming/), making it possible to style **shiny** apps and **rmarkdown** documents directly from R (via **sass**) instead of writing raw CSS and HTML. Currently, **bootstraplib** supports Bootstrap 3 and 4, as well as a special `"4+3"` compatibility version (read more about this in [choosing a version](#choosing-a-version)). Using **bootstraplib** in **shiny** and **rmarkdown** is still considered experimental at this point, but see the notes below to start using it today.

### Shiny

To start using **bootstraplib** in your **shiny** apps today, install `remotes::install_github("rstudio/shiny")`, then do the following:

1. Set the `bootstraplib` option to `TRUE`:

```r
shiny::shinyOptions(bootstraplib = TRUE)
```

2. Call `bs_global_theme()` and optionally specify a Bootstrap `version` and [`bootswatch` theme](https://bootswatch.com/). The current default is Bootstrap 4 (with added Bootstrap 3 compatibility) and no `bootswatch` theme:

```r
bs_global_theme(version = "4+3", bootswatch = NULL)
```

3. (Optional) Add theming customizations (learn more about customizations in the [recipes](https://rstudio.github.io/bootstraplib/articles/recipes.html) article):

```r
bs_base_colors(bg = "#444", fg = "#e4e4e4")
bs_theme_accent_colors(primary = "#e39777")
```

4. Run the Shiny app.

### R Markdown

To start using **bootstraplib** in your `rmarkdown::html_document`s, install `remotes::install_github("rstudio/rmarkdown#1706")`, then do the following:

(1) Use `bootstrap_version` and `theme` to choose the Bootstrap version and a Bootswatch theme. These arguments are currently supported only in `html_document` and `html_document_base`.

```yaml
---
output:
  html_document:
    bootstrap_version: 4+3
    theme: minty
---
```

(2) Optionally add theme customizations inside any R code chunk (these customizations end up influencing the Bootstrap CSS included in the output document).

    ```{r}`r ''`
    library(bootstraplib)
    bs_theme_accent_colors(primary = 'green')
    ```


## Choosing a version

The **bootstraplib** package currently supports three different `version`s: `"4+3"`, `4`, and `3`. In the future, when Bootstrap [releases more major versions](https://github.com/twbs/release), **bootstraplib** may add more versions, and may also change the default `version`. However, the default `version` (currently `"4+3"`) will always be designed to work well with core **shiny** UI functionality (e.g., `actionButton()`, `navlistPanel()`, etc). If your UI wants to assume a specific version of Bootstrap (i.e., it uses a package like **bs4Dash** or **yonder** to generate UI), then it's a good idea to set an explicit `version` (this way, when a new version of Bootstrap is released, and the default `version` changes, your app won't break). 

Be aware that Bootstrap 4 and 3 expose a very different set of theme customization entry points, and as a result, theme customizations that you write for Bootstrap 4 may not necessarily work for Bootstrap 3 (and vice versa). At the moment, our priority is to enable and improve the Bootstrap 4 theming experience. If you're not interested in upgrading to Bootstrap 4, and would rather theme your Bootstrap 3 project today, you may want to consider [using **fresh**](#fresh) in the near term.

## Interactive theming

**bootstraplib** also comes with tools for interactive theming of **shiny** apps (and **rmarkdown** documents with `runtime: shiny`). Either point `run_with_themer()` to an existing application or use `bs_theme_preview()` to use a pre-packaged application designed for theming. Note that as you interactively theme your application, code is printed to the R console that you can copy/paste to adopt those changes in your theming code.

```r
bs_global_theme(bootswatch = "sketchy")
bs_theme_preview()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/il6nd8J.gif")
```

## Similar work {#fresh}

The [**fresh** package](https://github.com/dreamRs/fresh) offers an alternative (& currently more user friendly) approach to theming via Bootstrap 3 Sass variables. At the moment, **bootstraplib** is more focused on laying an extensible foundation for theming with Bootstrap 3 (or 4) that other R packages can build upon. 

<!--
* Use [Bootstrap](https://sass-lang.com/) 4, as well as any major version of Bootstrap built on [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). 

  * Packages like **shiny**, **rmarkdown**, and many of their downstream dependencies have long depended on static Bootstrap 3 CSS, and may continue to do so by default. This package provides a means for upgrading to Bootstrap 4 (as well as compiling [Bootstrap 3 SASS](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass), and potentially, [future major versions](https://github.com/twbs/release) of Bootstrap). 

* Easily use pre-packaged [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) themes. 

* Create [custom Bootstrap themes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/theming) through compilation of user supplied [Sass](https://Sass-lang.com) code from R. 

To learn more, see the article on using **bootstraplib** with [**shiny**](articles/shiny.html) and [**rmarkdown**](articles/rmarkdown.html), as well as creating [custom Bootstrap themes](articles/custom.html).

## Via bs4 {#bs4}

The [**bs4** package](https://github.com/rstudio/bs4) provides a family of page layout functions (e.g., `bs_page_fluid()`, `bs_page_fixed()`, `bs_page()`) that provide a drop-in replacement to core **shiny** page layout functions (e.g., `fluidPage()`, `fixedPage()`, `bootstrapPage()`, etc). These **bs4** functions implictly include `bootstraplib::bs_dependencies()`, so **bootstraplib** theming functions like `bs_global_theme()` and `bs_theme_add_variables()` may be used to style the page without explictly including `bs_dependencies()`.

Eventually **bs4** will provide more replacements for core **shiny** UI functions that assume Bootstrap 4; but for now, you can use the **bs4Dash** package to generate similar UI with Bootstrap 4 compatible markup (as well as leverage new Bootstrap 4 features like [cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/card/)).

```r
library(bs4)
library(bs4Dash)

# Pin the version to Bootstrap version to 4 since 
# we're using UI functions designed specifically for BS4
bs_global_theme(version = 4)
bs_theme_add_variables(primary = "salmon")

ui_content <- bs4TabSetPanel(
  id = "panel", side = "left",
  bs4TabPanel("One", tabName = "One"),
  bs4TabPanel("Two", tabName = "Two")
)
ui <- bs4_page_fluid(ui_content)
shinyApp(ui, function(input, output) {})
```
