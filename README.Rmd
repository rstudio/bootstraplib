# bootstraplib

The **bootstraplib** R package provides tools for creating custom [Bootstrap themes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/theming/), making it easier to style Shiny apps and R Markdown documents directly from R (via **sass**) without writing unruly CSS and HTML. Currently, **bootstraplib** supports Bootstrap 3 and 4, as well as a special `"4+3"` compatibility version, which allows you to start using Bootstrap 4 today in Shiny and R Markdown.

## Installation

**bootstraplib** isnâ€™t yet available from CRAN, but you can install with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("rstudio/bootstraplib")
```

## Getting Started

Use `bs_theme()` to start a **bootstraplib** theme, where you can:

* Choose a (major) Bootstrap version.
  * To current default is `version = "4+3"`, which means Bootstrap 4 plus an additional compatibility layer for Bootstrap 3 style markup generated by Shiny and R Markdown. This allows most new and existing apps and documents to seamlessly upgrade to Bootstrap 4.
* Choose a Bootswatch theme (optional).
* Customize the main colors and fonts (see example below).
* More generally, customize any of Bootstrap's styling defaults via Sass variables.

For example, to implement a [material design inspired dark mode](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html):

```r
library(bootstraplib)
my_theme <- bs_theme(
  bg = "#202123", fg = "#B8BCC2", primary = "#EA80FC", 
  base_font = "Grandstander"
)
```

Now, to use `my_theme` inside of Shiny (or R Markdown0, pass it to the `theme` parameter, which you can find in any `shiny::bootstrapLib()` powered page layout like `shiny::navbarPage()`, `shiny::fluidPage()`, etc:

```r
library(shiny)
ui <- navbarPage(
  theme = my_theme,
  ...
)
shinyApp(ui, function(ui, server) {})
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("")
```

As well as a parameter to `rmarkdown::html_document()` (and `rmarkdown::html_document_base()`):

```yaml
---
output:
  html_document:
    theme: `r bootstraplib::bs_theme(bg = "#202123", fg = "#B8BCC2", primary = "#EA80FC", "Grandstander")`
---
```

```{r}
# TODO: get this working and provide a demo
#knitr::include_graphics("")
```

More generally, you can use a Bootstrap theme with any HTML page by using `shiny::bootstrapLib()` to compile the theme as an `htmltools::htmlDependency()` and adding that dependency to an `shiny::htmlTemplate()` or any HTML `shiny::tags` that you wish, for example:

```r
library(shiny)
ui <- htmlTemplate(
  "my-template.html",
  theme = my_theme,
  ...
)
shinyApp(ui, function(ui, server) {})
```

```html
<!-- my-template.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    {{ headContent() }}
    {{ bootstrapLib(theme) }}
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```


## What it does

```r

```



### Shiny

To start using **bootstraplib** in your **shiny** apps today, install `remotes::install_github("rstudio/shiny")`, then do the following:

1. Set the `bootstraplib` option to `TRUE`:

```r
shiny::shinyOptions(bootstraplib = TRUE)
```

2. Call `bs_global_theme()` and optionally specify a Bootstrap `version` and [`bootswatch` theme](https://bootswatch.com/). The current default is Bootstrap 4 (with added Bootstrap 3 compatibility) and no `bootswatch` theme:

```r
bs_global_theme(version = "4+3", bootswatch = NULL)
```

3. (Optional) Add theming customizations (learn more about customizations in the [recipes](https://rstudio.github.io/bootstraplib/articles/recipes.html) article):

```r
bs_base_colors(bg = "#444", fg = "#e4e4e4")
bs_theme_accent_colors(primary = "#e39777")
```

4. Run the Shiny app.

### R Markdown

To start using **bootstraplib** in your `rmarkdown::html_document`s, install `remotes::install_github("rstudio/rmarkdown#1706")`, then do the following:

(1) Use `bootstrap_version` and `theme` to choose the Bootstrap version and a Bootswatch theme. These arguments are currently supported only in `html_document` and `html_document_base`.

```yaml
---
output:
  html_document:
    bootstrap_version: 4+3
    theme: minty
---
```

(2) Optionally add theme customizations inside any R code chunk (these customizations end up influencing the Bootstrap CSS included in the output document).

    ```{r}`r ''`
    library(bootstraplib)
    bs_theme_accent_colors(primary = 'green')
    ```



## Interactive theming

**bootstraplib** also comes with tools for interactive theming of **shiny** apps (and **rmarkdown** documents with `runtime: shiny`). Either point `run_with_themer()` to an existing application or use `bs_theme_preview()` to use a pre-packaged application designed for theming. Note that as you interactively theme your application, code is printed to the R console that you can copy/paste to adopt those changes in your theming code.

```r
bs_global_theme(bootswatch = "sketchy")
bs_theme_preview()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/il6nd8J.gif")
```

## Similar work {#fresh}

The [**fresh** package](https://github.com/dreamRs/fresh) offers an alternative (& currently more user friendly) approach to theming via Bootstrap 3 Sass variables. At the moment, **bootstraplib** is more focused on laying an extensible foundation for theming with Bootstrap 3 (or 4) that other R packages can build upon. 

<!--
* Use [Bootstrap](https://sass-lang.com/) 4, as well as any major version of Bootstrap built on [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). 

  * Packages like **shiny**, **rmarkdown**, and many of their downstream dependencies have long depended on static Bootstrap 3 CSS, and may continue to do so by default. This package provides a means for upgrading to Bootstrap 4 (as well as compiling [Bootstrap 3 SASS](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass), and potentially, [future major versions](https://github.com/twbs/release) of Bootstrap). 

* Easily use pre-packaged [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) themes. 

* Create [custom Bootstrap themes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/theming) through compilation of user supplied [Sass](https://Sass-lang.com) code from R. 

To learn more, see the article on using **bootstraplib** with [**shiny**](articles/shiny.html) and [**rmarkdown**](articles/rmarkdown.html), as well as creating [custom Bootstrap themes](articles/custom.html).

## Via bs4 {#bs4}

The [**bs4** package](https://github.com/rstudio/bs4) provides a family of page layout functions (e.g., `bs_page_fluid()`, `bs_page_fixed()`, `bs_page()`) that provide a drop-in replacement to core **shiny** page layout functions (e.g., `fluidPage()`, `fixedPage()`, `bootstrapPage()`, etc). These **bs4** functions implictly include `bootstraplib::bs_dependencies()`, so **bootstraplib** theming functions like `bs_global_theme()` and `bs_theme_add_variables()` may be used to style the page without explictly including `bs_dependencies()`.

Eventually **bs4** will provide more replacements for core **shiny** UI functions that assume Bootstrap 4; but for now, you can use the **bs4Dash** package to generate similar UI with Bootstrap 4 compatible markup (as well as leverage new Bootstrap 4 features like [cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/card/)).

```r
library(bs4)
library(bs4Dash)

# Pin the version to Bootstrap version to 4 since 
# we're using UI functions designed specifically for BS4
bs_global_theme(version = 4)
bs_theme_add_variables(primary = "salmon")

ui_content <- bs4TabSetPanel(
  id = "panel", side = "left",
  bs4TabPanel("One", tabName = "One"),
  bs4TabPanel("Two", tabName = "Two")
)
ui <- bs4_page_fluid(ui_content)
shinyApp(ui, function(input, output) {})
```
