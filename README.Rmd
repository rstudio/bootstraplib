# bslib

The `bslib` R package provides tools for customizing [Bootstrap themes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/theming/) directly from R, making it much easier to customize the appearance of [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) apps & [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) documents. `bslib`'s primary goals are: 

* Make [custom theming]() as easy as possible.
  * Custom themes may even be created interactively in ["real-time"]().
* Make upgrading from Bootstrap 3 to 4 (and above) as seamless as possible.
  * Shiny and R Markdown default to Bootstrap 3 and will continue to do so to avoid breaking legacy code.
* Provide easy access to "pre-packaged" [Bootswatch themes]().
* Serve as a general foundation for Shiny and R Markdown [extension packages]() such as `{flexdashboard}`, `{pkgdown}`, `{bookdown}`, etc

After installing `bslib`, see the [Get Started article]() to learn more about using `bslib`.

## Installation

```

[Usage with R Markdown]() requires version 2.7 or higher:

```


## Getting help

There are two main places to get help with `bslib`:

+ The [RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/tags/c/R-Markdown/10/bslib) is a friendly place to ask any questions about flexdashboard. Be sure to use the `bslib` tag. Add also the `shiny` tag is you are using a Shiny runtime.

+ [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/bslib) is a great source of answers to common `bslib` questions. It is also a great place to get help, once you have created a reproducible example that illustrates your problem. Use the tags [`[r][bslib]`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/bslib+r) if you ask a question. Add the tag `[bslib]` if you are using a Shiny runtime.
